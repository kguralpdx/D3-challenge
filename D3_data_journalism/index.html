          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>

          <h5>Poverty vs. Lack of Healthcare</h5>
          <p>Based on the data in this scatter plot, it shows that there is a positive, linear relationship between poverty and
            and the lack of healthcare. Based on the states, it appears that the states with higher poverty levels and higher 
            need for healthcare are found most often in the southern region of the US.
          </p>

          <h5>Age vs. Lack of Healthcare</h5>
          <p>After reviewing the data in the scatter plot, there appears to be a minimal but positive, somewhat linear relationship between 
            the median age in a state and lack of healthcare. The dots are pretty spread out so the relationship between the two is weak. 
            With the exception of some outliers, it does look like states with an older median age do have more healthcare coverage.
          </p>

          <h5>Age vs. Smoking</h5>
          <p>Based on the data in this scatter plot, there does appear to be a positive, linear relationship between a state's median age 
            and the percentage of smokers. Utah, with the youngest population, also seems to have the fewest number of smokers so hopefully 
            that's a good sign for future generations of non-smokers. California and Texax, the two states with the biggest populations, 
            are also on the lower end of the smoker percentage.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Poverty vs. Smoking</h5>
          <p>After analyzing the data in this scatter plot, there does appear to be a positive, linear relationship between poverty 
            and the percentage of smokers. It's not a strong relationship as the dots are somewhat widespread. But the pattern is 
            uphill so it's positive.
          </p>

          <h5>Poverty vs. Obesity</h5>
          <p>Based on the data in this scatter plot, there does appear to be a positive, linear relationship between poverty 
            and the percentage of obese people. It's not a strong relationship as the dots are somewhat widespread. But the pattern is 
            uphill so it's positive. There might be a few outliers, though.
          </p>

          <h5>Age vs. Obesity</h5>
          <p>After analyzing the data in this scatter plot, there does appear to be a minimal but positive, somewhat linear relationship between 
            a state's median age and obesity. The dots, however, are pretty widespread so the relationship between the two is rather weak.
          </p>

          <h5>Household Income vs. Lack of Healthcare</h5>
          <p>Based on the data in this scatter plot, there appears to be a negative, somewhat linear relationship between 
            a state's median household income and a lack of healthcare. The dots are kind of widespread with at least one potential outlier 
            so the relationship between the two is weak to moderate.
          </p>

          <h5>Household Income vs. Smoking</h5>
          <p>After analyzing the data in this scatter plot, there does appear to be negative, linear relationship between 
            a state's median household income and smoking. The dots are sort of clustered together so the relationship between the two is moderate.
          </p>

          <h5>Household Income vs. Obesity</h5>
          <p>Based on the data in this scatter plot, there is a negative, linear relationship between a state's median household income and obesity. The dots
            are somewhat spread out, though, so the relationship between the two is weak to moderate. It is interesting that as household income increases, 
            the dots become more widespread.
